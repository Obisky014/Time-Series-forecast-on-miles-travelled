# Time-Series-forecast-on-miles-travelled
This was one of the more challenging projects i've attempted...and I'm still very skeptical about it. However, we are all here to learn new things on github at the very least.
In this one i tried using an ARIMA model to predict miles travelled from the 1970s up to 2020. I employed the use of Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test to aid with stationary tests and PACF and ACF to measure a correlation between a time series and its lagged versions.
I then went ahead to visualize it.
